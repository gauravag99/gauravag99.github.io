&lt;p>One of the pioneering methods of confirming the band gap predicted by the
BCS theory was using superconducting tunnel junctions. We outline the low temperature techniques used and measure electron tunneling in normal(Ag) - superconductor(NbN) tunnel junctions. We confirm the predictions of the BCS theory. We demonstrate phenomenological factors that are intricately linked to the physics of superconductors. Further, we measure these tunnel junctions in magnetic fields and present Maki analysis on the data collected. Python programs are
also developed for automatic data analysis and parameter extraction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graphene - Electronic Properties and Defects</title><link>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/graphene/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/graphene/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Graphene is one of the first 2-D materials to be discovered. We examine its
physical structure and review the tight-binding model of Graphene with the next-
nearest neighbour interaction. Only considering nearest neighbour hopping, we
demonstrate the importance of Dirac points, the onset of the relativistic for-
mulation and electrons acquiring pseudo-spin. We also show the e-h symmetry
breaking on the inclusion of next-nearest hopping. Additionally, we derive the
commonly stated density of states using Greenâ€™s function. Further, we model
substitutional impurities in the Graphene lattice by the Slater-Koster model and
derive the change in the band structure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>fractional Brownian Motion (fBM)</title><link>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/fracbrown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/fracbrown/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Brownian Motion serves as the foundation of a myriad of statistical modelling. Here, we discuss the statistical properties of Weiner processes, and introduce Brownian Motion as a continuous Weiner process. Further, we model it using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations and study the motion of particles in a 1-D box. This is supplemented by simulations. Further, &lt;em>fractional Brownian Motion&lt;/em> is introduced as a generalisation and its statistical properties are studied. Its non-trivial simulation is also done by two methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development of a Data Acquisition system</title><link>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/dataacq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/dataacq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Basket of experiments in the UG lab.</title><link>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/uglab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gauravag99.github.io/project/uglab/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
