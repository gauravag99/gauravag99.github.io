I'm currently pursuing an  integrated masters in Physics currently at the Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, Mumbai. I like diving into technical problems whilst working with my hands as well behind the keyboard.

Recently, I have been working towards my Master's Thesis involving QM's FPGA module [OPX](https://www.quantum-machines.co/platform/), optimal qubit control using machine learning as well as component optimisation of the RF chain on the superconducting qubits platform for a 7 qubit ring resonator coupled processor at the [QuMaC Lab](https://www.tifr.res.in/~quantro/index.html), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/).
