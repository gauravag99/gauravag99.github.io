I'm currently a first year Physics graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. I like diving into technical problems whilst working with my hands as well behind the keyboard.

Recently, I have been working towards building a 'universal' data logger for the [Hatlab](http://hatlab.pitt.edu/) for lab instruments with ESP32(s) and Pi.  My previous work for my Master's Thesis involved QM's FPGA module [OPX](https://www.quantum-machines.co/platform/), optimal qubit control using machine learning as well as component optimisation of the RF chain on the superconducting qubits platform at the [QuMaC Lab](https://www.tifr.res.in/~quantro/index.html), [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in/).
