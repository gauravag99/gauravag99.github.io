title: Basket of experiments in the UG lab.
summary: What can a guy straight out of school with no clear direction do in a lab during the summer? Turns out, enough to not get bored everyday and learn physics while at it. I did a series of experiments starting from measuring *frequency responses of Piezo-electric materials*, generating *diffraction patterns with microwaves*, *DIY-ing a Lock-in Amplifier* and playing with some optical benches.
