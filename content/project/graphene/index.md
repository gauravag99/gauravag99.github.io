title: Graphene - Electronic Properties and Defects
summary: Graphene's tight-binding model with next-nearest neighbour hopping is often ignored, here I go through the math - not mentioned anywhere - and build from the ground up the band structure and the bizzare electronic properties. Next, we introduce some sustitutional defects into the lattice and employ the Koster-Slater model to study them.

## Abstract
Graphene is one of the first 2-D materials to be discovered. We examine its
physical structure and review the tight-binding model of Graphene with the next-
nearest neighbour interaction. Only considering nearest neighbour hopping, we
demonstrate the importance of Dirac points, the onset of the relativistic for-
mulation and electrons acquiring pseudo-spin. We also show the e-h symmetry
breaking on the inclusion of next-nearest hopping. Additionally, we derive the
commonly stated density of states using Green’s function. Further, we model
substitutional impurities in the Graphene lattice by the Slater-Koster model and
derive the change in the band structure.
