title: Superconducting Tunnel Junctions
summary: One of the most mind-blowing ways of confirming BCS theory is superconducting junctions. Sandwich an insulator between a superconductor and a metal and you can only have conductivity once the bias you provide is above BCS band gap. I simulated, measured and analysed the behaviour of superconducting tunnel junctions with and without axial magnetic feilds in this project.

## Abstract
One of the pioneering methods of confirming the band gap predicted by the
BCS theory was using superconducting tunnel junctions. We outline the low temperature techniques used and measure electron tunneling in normal(Ag) - superconductor(NbN) tunnel junctions. We confirm the predictions of the BCS theory. We demonstrate phenomenological factors that are intricately linked to the physics of superconductors. Further, we measure these tunnel junctions in magnetic fields and present Maki analysis on the data collected. Python programs are
also developed for automatic data analysis and parameter extraction.
