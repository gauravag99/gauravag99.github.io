## Abstract
One of the pioneering methods of confirming the band gap predicted by the
BCS theory was using superconducting tunnel junctions. We outline the low temperature techniques used and measure electron tunneling in normal(Ag) - superconductor(NbN) tunnel junctions. We confirm the predictions of the BCS theory. We demonstrate phenomenological factors that are intricately linked to the physics of superconductors. Further, we measure these tunnel junctions in magnetic fields and present Maki analysis on the data collected. Python programs are
also developed for automatic data analysis and parameter extraction.
