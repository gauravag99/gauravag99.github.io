title: fractional Brownian Motion (fBM)
summary: A lot of real world statistical modelling is done through the lens of Brownian motion. I develop brownian motion with Langevin & Fokker-Planck equations supplemented with simulations. To generalize this further, fractional Brownian motion is studied with its statistical properties, arcsine laws, and simulations.

## Abstract
Brownian Motion serves as the foundation of a myriad of statistical modelling. Here, we discuss the statistical properties of Weiner processes, and introduce Brownian Motion as a continuous Weiner process. Further, we model it using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations and study the motion of particles in a 1-D box. This is supplemented by simulations. Further, *fractional Brownian Motion* is introduced as a generalisation and its statistical properties are studied. Its non-trivial simulation is also done by two methods.
