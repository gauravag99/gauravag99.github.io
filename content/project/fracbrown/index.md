title: fractional Brownian Motion
summary: A lot of real world statistical modelling is done through the lens of Brownian motion. I develop brownian motion with Langevin & Fokker-Planck equations supplemented with simulations. To generalize this further, fractional Brownian motion is studied with its statistical properties, arcsine laws, and simulations.

## Abstract
Graphene is one of the first 2-D materials to be discovered. We examine its
physical structure and review the tight-binding model of Graphene with the next-
nearest neighbour interaction. Only considering nearest neighbour hopping, we
demonstrate the importance of Dirac points, the onset of the relativistic for-
mulation and electrons acquiring pseudo-spin. We also show the e-h symmetry
breaking on the inclusion of next-nearest hopping. Additionally, we derive the
commonly stated density of states using Greenâ€™s function. Further, we model
substitutional impurities in the Graphene lattice by the Slater-Koster model and
derive the change in the band structure.
