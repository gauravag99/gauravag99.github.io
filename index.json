A common method for generating these pulses is the single side band up-conversion scheme which utilizes an IQ Mixer and two modulating signals from arbitrary waveform generators. In this thesis, we discuss an alternative scheme, referred to as double frequency up-conversion, which aims to reduce the number of required modulating signals to one, eschews periodic calibrations and accommodates a wider range of qubit frequencies. We partially implement this scheme, demonstrate the measurement and analysis of a single qubit, and present evidence that the long-term stability of the alternative scheme is comparable to that of the standard setup.\n","date":1672358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672358400,"objectID":"8f19341a798c01cde9e95fcda31ff528","permalink":"https://gauravag99.github.io/project/superhet/","publishdate":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/superhet/","section":"project","summary":"We tested a double frequency upconversion scheme to generate microwave pulses for control and readout of qubits which aims to reduce the number of required modulating signals to one, eschews periodic calibrations and accommodates a wider range of qubit frequencies","tags":["QC","inst"],"title":"Two stage double frequency up-conversion scheme","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract One of the pioneering methods of confirming the band gap predicted by the BCS theory was using superconducting tunnel junctions. We outline the low temperature techniques used and measure electron tunneling in normal(Ag) - superconductor(NbN) tunnel junctions. We confirm the predictions of the BCS theory. We demonstrate phenomenological factors that are intricately linked to the physics of superconductors. Further, we measure these tunnel junctions in magnetic fields and present Maki analysis on the data collected.

We examine its physical structure and review the tight-binding model of Graphene with the next- nearest neighbour interaction. Only considering nearest neighbour hopping, we demonstrate the importance of Dirac points, the onset of the relativistic for- mulation and electrons acquiring pseudo-spin. We also show the e-h symmetry breaking on the inclusion of next-nearest hopping. Additionally, we derive the commonly stated density of states using Green’s function.
