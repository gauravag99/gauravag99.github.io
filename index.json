We outline the low temperature techniques used and measure electron tunneling in normal(Ag) - superconductor(NbN) tunnel junctions. We confirm the predictions of the BCS theory. We demonstrate phenomenological factors that are intricately linked to the physics of superconductors. Further, we measure these tunnel junctions in magnetic fields and present Maki analysis on the data collected. Python programs are also developed for automatic data analysis and parameter extraction.\n","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"1547644134520cf177cf29727baac47f","permalink":"https://gauravag99.github.io/project/tunneljunc/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tunneljunc/","section":"project","summary":"Simulated, measured and analysed the behaviour of superconducting tunnel junctions with and without axial magnetic feilds.","tags":["supercond"],"title":"Superconducting Tunnel Junctions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Graphene is one of the first 2-D materials to be discovered.
